- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- Prefer descriptive variable and function names over comments. Only add comments when documenting reasoning that cannot be conveyed through clear naming
- Search through .md files in the repository for documentation before implementing changes or adding new logic
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
Always implement high quality production ready code that performs the requested task, using the requested tools, libraries, external systems, infrastructure etc. Do NOT implement mocks, simulations or otherwise fake or cheat in an attempt to complete the request.

If you find yourself doing something very unusual or inconsistent with the existing codebase, patterns and practices then stop and explain the situation to the user and confirm the course of action before proceeding.
